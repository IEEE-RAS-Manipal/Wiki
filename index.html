		<h1>About</h1>
		<div id="about-text">
		<p>
			 We at IEEE-Robotics and Automation(RAS),student chapter Manipal Institute of Technology(MIT),Manipal, strive to advance innovation and applied research in robotics and automation.The society emphasizes on Robotics, Robotics research and Automation research. Each of the three domains deal with systems incorporating various sensors and actuators that can operate autonomously or semi-autonomously, the intelligence and adaptability to cope with unstructured environments, lastly the efficiency, productivity and quality, focusing on systems that operate autonomously.
		</p>
		<p>			
			The IEEE-RAS Manipal Student Branch Chapter, as one of the countless chapters like it spread across India and the world, strives to promote the community among students in the local arena, by helping them develop their technical skills and professional network through the plethora of resources that IEEE-RAS provides.

		<h1> Subsystems</h1>
		<div class="sub1">
		<h2> Computer Science </h2>
		<p>
			The CS subsystem is responsible for the algorithmic aspects of the mechatronic systems pertaining to the sense-think-act paradigm. It will further be bifurcated into perception and planning to work in tandem with the controls vertical. Members will use cutting-edge techniques like AI, computer vision, statistical and probabilistic planning and frameworks like ROS to ease the former.
		</p>
		</div>	
		<div class="sub1">
		<h2> Electronics and Controls </h2>
		<p>
			The electronics subsystem is responsible for the design, creation and management of the systems that integrate with the other subsystems and create an idea of sustainable circuitry to manage the process of automation. Members will use software like LTSpice, Proteus, and Vivado to design circuitry in tandem with coding microcontrollers like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub1">
		<h2>Mechanical</h2>
		<p>
			The Mechanical subsystem is responsible for mechanical design and mathematical modelling & simulation, with their main aim being bringing our endeavours from the drawing board into reality. Members will utilise MATLAB to aid with modelling designs made on Autodesk Fusion 360, among other software like ANSYS, Solidworks etc.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub2">
		<h2> Human Resources</h2>
		<p>
			Human Resources subsytem is responsible for the entire life cycle of members, which includes recruiting dedicated members, and training them to get the best out of each and every one. The HR is also responsible for maintaining records of all the members at all times. Members will learn how to effectively manage personnel and logistics, create project and technical documentation for our activities, and assist with tracking the finances of the organisation.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub2">
		<h2> Media & Marketing</h2>
		<p>
			The Media and Marketing subsystem is responsible for copywriting, creating content, posts and videos on social media. Promoting the organisation via various social media strategies, to have the maximum reach possible is another major aspect of this subsystem. Members will utilise the Adobe ecosystem (Illustrator, Photoshop, Premier Pro etc.) to create eye-catching media, and create targeted content to publicise on our various social media handles.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub2">
		<h2> IT & Development </h2>
		<p>
			The IT & Development subsystem supervises and maintains all technological integrations utilised by our organisation, like Linux, GitHub, Google Workspace, Office 365, etc. They also support the other subsystems with the technological know-how require to work with these software. Members will learn Linux, Bash Scripting, Open-Source Software, and Web Development among other essential skills to become an effective SysAdmin.
